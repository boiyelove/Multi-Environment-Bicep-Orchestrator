# Multi-Environment-Bicep-Orchestrator

Manage complete environment lifecycles safely with Bicep and Azure Deployment Stacks.

## Project metadata

The metadata below is derived from tracked source, manifests, and infrastructure
files. It describes what this repository includes; live-service integration remains
bounded by the documented deployment and validation limitations.

| Category | Included |
| --- | --- |
| Platforms | Microsoft Azure; GitHub Actions |
| Services and stack | Bicep; Deployment Stacks; GitHub Actions; Log Analytics |
| Languages and formats | Python; Bicep; Bicep parameters; Bash; JSON; YAML |
| Delivery and IaC | Bicep + `.bicepparam`; GitHub Actions CI; YAML configuration; Python validation/tests |

## Problem statement

An environment promotion request is converted into an approved Deployment Stack plan with tenant scope, deterministic evidence, private defaults, and explicit production authorization.

A production implementation can still fail even when every resource deploys successfully. The material risk is configuration that passes syntax checks but violates control intent, or an exception that reaches farther and lasts longer than expected. The design therefore treats Bicep, Deployment Stacks, GitHub Actions, and the surrounding identity and evidence controls as one reviewable system rather than unrelated configuration tasks.

## Example case study

### Situation

Application teams deploy dev, test, and production from copied scripts that leave orphaned resources after changes. The orchestrator gives each environment a governed lifecycle and a reviewable cleanup boundary.

### Response

A platform team promotes identical modules through development, staging, and production. Deployment Stacks expose deletions and drift, environment parameters remain explicit, and production adds approval and freshness requirements.

The team first exercises the repository's synthetic approved and denied fixtures. An approved request must produce the same idempotent plan on replay; a stale, unscoped, public, or unapproved request must fail before an Azure adapter is allowed to run.

### Expected outcome

Stakeholders receive a decision package they can attach to a change record: requested scope, controls evaluated, the reason for approval or denial, and the explicit handoff to live integration. The example supports design review and incident rehearsal without pretending that a local test changed Azure.

## Architecture

Layered Bicep modules and typed environment parameters drive Deployment Stacks for development, test, and production. What-if, approvals, deny settings, state ownership, diagnostics, and explicit deletion policy govern updates and cleanup.

Primary services: `Bicep`, `Deployment Stacks`, `GitHub Actions`, `Log Analytics`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

The upper boundary names the principal services and technologies used by this repository. The lower boundary shows the implemented control flow: desired state is validated, provider action remains an explicit integration gate, and sanitized evidence is retained for review and deterministic replay.

## Best complementary diagram

**Recommended view: Environment promotion and deployment-stack lifecycle.** A lifecycle view is the strongest complement because it makes state transitions, approval points, expiry or recovery, and operational ownership explicit.

![Icon-based environment promotion and deployment-stack lifecycle for Multi-Environment-Bicep-Orchestrator](docs/operational-view.svg)

The view follows **Version desired release → Bind environment parameters → Deploy and reconcile stack → Promote or retire safely**. Use it during design reviews, operational walkthroughs, and failure-mode discussions; use the logical architecture above when the question is which technologies integrate.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md) and [`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.

## Infrastructure inputs

Resource behavior and deploy-time values are intentionally separated:

- [Bicep template](infra/main.bicep) — Azure resources, modules, and security controls.
- [Bicep parameters](infra/main.bicepparam) — environment-specific names, regions, identities, and feature inputs.

Start with the parameter file's safe values, replace synthetic identifiers, and run an Azure what-if before deployment.
